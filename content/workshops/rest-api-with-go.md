## Pitch

If you have been around a computer for long enough you probably are familiar with the term API maybe even REST API. But what are they really and why we in the Go community care about REST API? In this talk I will try to go over all you need to know to build your first or next REST API in Go.

## Description

Go is a language heavily used for web api building. What makes a good api? How can we build apis that are robust and extensible? Writing a good API is an evolving process.

If you are coming to Go from a different language you might be used to using some framework for building REST APIs. Although that seems to increase developer productivity in the beginning, I feel like you loose a lot of visibility and flexibility because of the abstraction. The Go ecosystem favors libraries over frameworks. We will use a library to build our API. Using a library gives us the ability to easily change and modify our API.

In this talk we will learn why use go for api building and learn some of the best practices in making a good API.
