## Pitch

If you are someone who is trying to learn how to use Kubernetes you probably already know the high level overview. There are great resources for it already. We are gonna talk about the second week stuff. The ones intro tutorials usually miss and advance tutorials gloss over.

## Description

Kubernetes is probably the de-facto container orchestrator for most people using container orchestrators. There is a huge demand for it as well as a lot of interest among people to learn Kubernetes. I like most people wanted to learn how it all worked. And donâ€™t get me wrong the docs for Kubernetes are great. The community as a whole also created many tutorials, blog posts, videos books etc. But I still find something is missing. The intro tutorials are too basic sometimes. They are great if you want to learn the architecture of Kubernetes and how it all fits together. There are some real advance use case tutorials that dive deep in one aspect of K8s. But there is missing link.

I hope to help bridge that with this session. We will look at what I call second week of learning Kubernetes. You got the idea behind Kubernetes. You have played a bit with minikube. You have deployed the nginx server. But whats next?

We will talk about other lesser known but important features of k8s. We will tackle things like rollout, rollback, resource quotas, private image registry, continuous deployment and many more. You know, the second week stuff !!
